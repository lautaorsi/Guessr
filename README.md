This is Videoguessr, my first "serious" project that I did for a very long time (whenever I had some free time), it was very fun seeing how to integrate front-end, back-end and multiple API's including Youtube's and openLeaf. <br>
As you can see here, this is only the static site, I used plain HTML and CSS for the front-end and Javascript for the back-end, using Node.JS and sockets was something I really enjoyed and actually would like to use again. <br>
Here you will see a lot of horrible code practices, very bad file management and an overall very amateur project, but keeping in mind it was my first hands-on, iterative, and individual project I am actually proud of it. <br>
